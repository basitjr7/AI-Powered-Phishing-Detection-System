##  ⚙️ About the Project 

An AI-powered phishing detection system using machine learning to classify emails as **phishing** or **safe**. Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn**, this system analyzes email bodies and URLs to detect phishing attempts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Email Body Analysis**: Uses text processing to identify phishing patterns.
- **URL Scanning**: Extracts and evaluates URLs within the email to detect malicious links.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained with labeled phishing data to make predictions on email content.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

## 🎯 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Powered-Phishing-Detection-System.git
   cd AI-Powered-Phishing-Detection-System

2. Install Dependencies
   Create and activate a virtual environment, then install required packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the App
   Start the Streamlit app to launch the phishing detection system:
   ```bash
   streamlit run phishing_detection.py

4. Upload Dataset for Training (Optional)
   Upload a CSV file with columns email_body (content of the email) and label (1 for phishing, 0 for safe) to train the model.

🔍 How to Use

- **Training the Model**: Upload a CSV file containing emails labeled as phishing or safe.
- **Prediction**: Enter the body of an email, and the system will classify it as phishing or safe.

Example Email to Test:

- **Phishing Email**:
  
  ```bash
  Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card. Click here to claim your prize: http://phishing.com

- **Safe Email**:

  ```bash
  Hey, just checking in on our project. Let me know your availability for a meeting.

5. Check Prediction
   Click Check Phishing to see the prediction results for the email you entered.

## 📊 Results

The system will display whether the email is a phishing attempt or safe based on its body content and URL features.
